Hello all! I am Kyla! Here are a few facts about me:
- Iâ€™m currently learning Full Stack Web Development at Bloomtech!
- I'm am from Hawaii but am current based in Denver, CO.
- I am generally more of an artistic person I enjoy painting, drawing, singing, and playing ukulele!
- I have a sweet black lab named Jake!

I love working hard and learning new things. Codeing provides me with opportunities to go out of my confort zone and challenges me to learn new skills. I look forward to meeting new people in tech and collaborating to make something awesome!
